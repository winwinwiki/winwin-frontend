// The above method does a couple of things.

// 1. It takes a file object as a parameter.

// 2. Generates a unique file name using the current timestamp (Date.now()). Of course, if your app is being used heavily this might not be the best way to create a unique filename. But this should be fine for now.

// 3. Upload the file to the userâ€™s folder in S3 using the Storage.vault.put() object. Alternatively, if we were uploading publicly you can use the Storage.put() method.

// And return the stored object in this case image.
